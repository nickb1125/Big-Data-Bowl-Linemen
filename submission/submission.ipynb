    "# A Metric for Situational Defensive Linemen Performance in Increasing Team Liklihood of Play Disruruption\n",

    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visualize exemplary and breathtaking athletisism, our 300-pound friends on the defensive line are not typically the first to come to mind - but maybe they should be. While NFL Quarterbacks are most commonly praised for the amazing last-second touchdowns that frequent RedZone highlight reels, they complete a more impressive feat at the beginning of every play: taking the snap in front of four, probabily hungry, linemen whom have no other goal than to hit, block, and all around oblitorate the offense. If you're not convinced, the Buffilo Bills hit on Mike White during week 14 might change your mind.\n",

    "The importance of the defensive-linemen to the game of football is severely understated, but some are certainly more influential on play trajectory than others. How, then can we appropriately assess skill on the defensive line? This paper describes a metric used to describe how much better a defensive linemen preforms in the same situations as other linemen in the league, reliant on how much he improves his team's chances of play distruption at (1) instantanious points in time, (2) over a single play, and (3) over the entire season. Moreover, it aims to identify not neccecarily the most flashy defensive linemen with the most individual disruptions, but instead those who increase their teams chances of overall disruption the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Many current assessments of defensive linemen rely on the simple number of indivual disruptions (i.e., sack, hurry, etc) that a lineman records. While this is simple to compute, it doesnt really show us much of the full picture. Sure, such numbers might tell us who has the most hightlight hits on their resume, but they give us little perspective on what linemen are helping their team the most overall. Put more bluntly, it undervalues the \"playmakers\" of defensive line. Any defensive linemen can reach the quarterback when unblocked, and similarly any defensive linemen that draws a double block every play can be stunted. What is imminently important is not neccecarily who draws the most pressure or the most sacks, but instead who helps his team's chances of play disruption most, given where on the field he is and how many blockers there are between him and the quarterback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our metric is centered around the idea that, on any given play, a rusher improves his entire lines chance of achieving a pass disruption by some proability. This probability, if intuitively estimated, can serve as a estimator of how effective a defensive linemen is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability of Distruption at the Team Level\n",
    "\n",
    "#### i. Feature Selection & Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "While the general goal of our defensive pass rush performance metric is to assess the skill of an individual in pass distruption, the dynamics of the pass rush are certainly team-oriented. As offensive and defensive linemen clash on the line of scrimmage, pass blockers are beaten and switch to different rushers, and rushers are met with spatial obstructions having to do with rushers and blockers beyond their current assignment. As a result, instead of modeling the likliehood of individual rushers disrupting pass plays, we found it to be much more appropriate to consider a teams liklihood of disrupting a pass plays cohesively at each point of time in a play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling a team's probability of pass distruption required feature engineering utilizing individual player spatial data at various time points throught the play. \n",

    "</tr></table>\n",

    "\n",
    "#### ii. Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Using created features pulled from individual rusher tracking data, we selected a one layer long-short-term-memory (LSTM) nueral network model for preforming the task of time series classification at various points in time for the binary play disruption outcome. [Insert criteria for play disruption here]. Typically, LSTM models for time series classification only train and backpropogate according to losses in the final fully connected layer (i.e., since usually the entire time series is of one class). For our purposes, though, we need an alternative method which trains the probabilities of a play disruption at all points in time during a play. Concequently, we calculate and train our LSTM model on the equally weighted sum of losses in predicting play distruption at each point in the play. Each tenth of a second after the snap, a cross entropy loss value is calculated for the prediction of true play disruption, or lack thereof. The total of these losses is used for backpropigation.\n",

    "### Replacement of Individual Pass Rusher Data with Situational Averages\n",
    "\n",
    "We utilize the fact that individual spatial tracking data is used to create features for the long-short-term-memory model to determine how well individual rushers preformed on the same play. To do so we first collect rusher spatial averages over various times after the snap for players in the same \"start-of-play\" situation. We define such \"start-of-play\" situational groupings by (1) number of blockers over the course of the play, (2) positional location of player at snap, and (3) [????].\n",
